This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(reshape2)
library(stringr)

# Read the data
hospital_charges_data <- read.csv("inpatientCharges.csv")

# Preview the first few rows of the dataset
head(hospital_charges_data)

# Clean and process the data
wisconsin_hospital_data <- hospital_charges_data %>%
  filter(`Provider.State` == "WI") %>%
  mutate(
    `Average Covered Charges` = as.numeric(str_remove_all(`Average.Covered.Charges`, "\\$|,")),
    `Average Total Payments` = as.numeric(str_remove_all(`Average.Total.Payments`, "\\$|,")),
    `Average Medicare Payments` = as.numeric(str_remove_all(`Average.Medicare.Payments`, "\\$|,"))
  ) %>%
  group_by(`Provider.City`) %>%
  summarise(
    `Average Covered Charges` = mean(`Average Covered Charges`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Average Total Payments` = mean(`Average Total Payments`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Average Medicare Payments` = mean(`Average Medicare Payments`, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Reshape data for plotting
wisconsin_hospital_data_long <- wisconsin_hospital_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("Average Covered Charges", "Average Total Payments", "Average Medicare Payments"),
    names_to = "Measurement",
    values_to = "Value"
  )

# Create a bar plot
ggplot(wisconsin_hospital_data_long, aes(x = `Provider.City`, y = Value, fill = Measurement)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(
    title = "Healthcare Payments/Charges by Provider City in Wisconsin",
    subtitle = "Average costs for different types of payments",
    x = "Provider City (Wisconsin)",
    y = "Average Cost",
    fill = "Type"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Average Covered Charges" = "blue", "Average Total Payments" = "red", "Average Medicare Payments" = "green")) +

  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = "dashed"),

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
